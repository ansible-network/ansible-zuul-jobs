      Jobs that *every* project in Ansible Network CI should have by default.

      This is automatically added to all projects in Ansible Network CI, no
      repository should use this directly.

    # and we can report invalid zuul.yaml files.

      This template runs no jobs, it is needed if a project does not use
      any single job so that changes can get merged.

      Do not use this with projects that have jobs defined in the gate
      pipeline.
